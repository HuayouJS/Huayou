HuayouJS is a 2D graphics JavaScript library based on SVG, which provides Pan And Zoom functionality that native SVG does not have, while also supports managing SVG graphic elements by layer. Compared to similar products, HuayouJS has the following important features:
1. Support developers to use the SVG native object model and API to develop applications without increasing additional learning costs.
2. No performance loss compared to native SVG.
